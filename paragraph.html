      Parrots are known as one of the most intelligent birds, along with crows,
      magpies, and jays. Parrots have the ability to understand the emotions and
      behaviours of humans. They can also speak the human language, which is why
      they are called talking birds. Parrots are found in dense forests and
      mostly in flocks.
